-----  ATCsim DESCRIPTION  -----

ATCsim (Air Traffic Control simulation) is the 2013 project of an introduction
course on object-oriented programming in C++ at EPFL (CS-118).
It simulates an (obviously simplified) Air Traffic Control workstation like the
ones operators play in reality (for example at Skyguide).

-----  PROJECT GOAL  -----

The goal of this project was mainly C++ training. We focused on C++11
improvements and new features, as it makes this language more powerful, and
easier to use for application development. We also focused on the toolkit, using
of course gcc, netbeans, but also git and clang. We tried as much as possible to
follow design patterns and best practices.
