Collision prediction is implemented using the already developed computeMovement
and checkForCollision methods. We only introduce an argument indicating if we
act on the real position or on a simulated position. The simulated position is
reinitialized to the real position on each tick by the resetSimulation method,
before we start to simulate.


Architecture changes :

  -- Implement Surface class as an object-oriented abstraction for SDL_Surface.
  -- Implement FPS as a namespace
  -- In the case of our simulation, we don't need to store collisions in a queue.
     For efficiency we handle collisions directly after detection.
