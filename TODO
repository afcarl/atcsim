-----  TODO  -----

exception class : fatal (exit), warning
Implement exceptions handling and throwing (with exception specifications at function declarations), catch (exception& e) (throw std::invalid_argument("id");)

Add Doxygen / Javadoc comments to source code
Automatically generate documentation based on Doxygen / Javadoc comments
Generate automatically the class hierarchy

Add const keyword on methods parameters and core. (const value param only in definition, not declaration)
Pass object by reference instead of value

find a better way to calculate FPS in realtime not every second

link to libc++ (LLVM Clang) instead of libstdc++ (GNU GCC)
Use Valgrind to detect memory leak and/or GCC AddressSanitizer / ThreadSanitizer
Use a tool to automatically check code quality / format (static analysis)
create unit tests
verify destructor destroy what was created by constructor (especially free the pointers)
Verify answers in RESPONSES file
Add licence information (GPL or BSD)
Unifiy source code style (format, variable / class / method names etc.)
Apply http://geosoft.no/development/cppstyle.html/
Use virtual inheritance to avoid problems whith multiple inheritance. (There is more often multiple inheritance when we use interfaces.)
Start using git branching and merging functions to work on interleaved changes.
different typecasting : http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/typecasting/
control namespaces
as much as possible, do not define nor declare default copy constructor or assignement operator and use the compiler-generated one (OK if not using pointers etc.)
you shouldn't do "using namespace X" within a header file because it forces namespace pollution and subverts the namespaces
templates and generic programming
C++11 attributes In-class member initializers in header : int{10}
use profiling tools to optimize (memory access, cache miss, page fault, branch prediction)
don't render at infinite speed, implement framerate
use C++ cout << "text" << endl; style instead of C printf("text") style

mark methods that wonâ€™t be implemented with '= delete' (C++11), example for private copy constructor and operator=
C++ '= default' for default copy constructor, operator=, destructor



-----  EVENTUALLY  -----

JOURNAL, REPONSES, CONCEPTION, README in Latex
Add doc folder to repository
Add anonymous clone to main GIT repository (hosted on git.epfl.ch)
use template for heterogeneous collection
heterogeneous collection shoold be a class
inherit airplane and cloud move from a common interface
optimize to get the highest possible FPS
javascript port with emscripten (take LLVM bytecode)
use C++11 final keyword (technically identifier)



-----  DONE  -----

create a GIT repository
use forward declaration (#include "A.h" --> class A;) in header files when possible to avoid namespace pollution and reduce build time
C++11 : unique_ptr, shared_ptr, weak_ptr
refactor the Surface class as object-oriented (unlike SDL) to be easier to use and exception safe (destructor)
use atexit(SDL_Quit);
use new C++11 typed null pointer 'nullptr' instead of NULL (enforced by GCC 4.7 -Wzero-as-null-pointer-constant)
remove all warnings with -Wextra and -Weffc++ and a bunch of others
manually written Makefile : debug or release configuration ? ==> the two, all (default) implies debug and release
choose warning and optimization flags
compile with Clang (LLVM)
use new C++11 auto keywork
explicitly define the 6 special member functions : default ctor, copy ctor, move ctor, copy assignment op, move assignment op, dtor



-----  WILL NOT BE DONE  -----

use unique_ptr for SDL_Surface*  ==>  implemented a wrapper object Surface with constructor and destructor
